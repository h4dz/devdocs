<h1 class="title">Incidents API</h1>
<p>
<strong>
Note that to create an incident you need to trigger it through the <a href="/documentation/integration/events/">events</a> API.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
PagerDuty receives updates (called <i>events</i>) from monitoring systems through services
(like Nagios, email or generic API calls). Upon receiving an event, active services will create a
new incident and begin escalating it as defined by the service's escalation policy.
Events can be de-duplicated into existing incidents based on service de-duplication rules to prevent
you from being overwhelmed by event storms.
</p>
<p>
An incident can be open, acknowledged or resolved. Whenever an incident is created, it is assigned
to a user (according to the escalation process, as described by escalation rules and
<a href="/documentation/rest/schedules">schedules</a>).
The assigned user has a chance to either acknowledge that he is working on it, or to resolve it.
</p>
<p>
Resolving an incident closes it, whereas acknowledging it halts the escalation process.
If the incident is not resolved by the service's <i>incident ack timeout</i> it continues up the escalation chain.
</p>
<p>
When an incident is triggered or when it is escalated it creates
<a href="/documentation/rest/alerts">alerts</a> (also known as <i>notifications</i>). Alerts are messages
containing the details of the incident, and can be sent through SMS, email and phone calls.
</p>
<p>
Incidents and Incident Counts from the last 30 days are returned by default. To change this default date range, see the documentation for the <code>since</code>, <code>until</code> or <code>date_range</code> parameters.
