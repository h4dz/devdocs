    GET incidents

  <p>
    The PagerDuty incidents query API can be used to query current and historical PagerDuty incidents over a date range, letting you build custom dashboards or incident reports. The API allows for searching for incidents with multiple filters or query parameters, various sorts, and also supports the pagination of results.
