    Services API
  </h1>
  <p>
    A service is an endpoint (like Nagios, email, or an API call) that generates events, which Pagerduty normalizes and dedupes, creating <a href="/documentation/rest/incidents">incidents</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a service is shown inlined in other resources, a deleted service will have its html_url attribute set to null.
  </p>
  <table class="table action_index">

      This API lets you access and manipulate the services across your account.
